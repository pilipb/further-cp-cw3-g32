This grid was solved using the wavefront algorithm.

The following are the times taken by each algorithm to solve the grid (note if 0.0 it is likely due to the small scale and bit errors):
Wavefront: 0.0
Recursion: 0.0189666748046875
Combination (recursion + quickfill): 0.0

Above is a partially completed grid (it contains 5 hints).
The following is a list of where the hints that were inserted.
