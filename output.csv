The solution grid is taken from the wavefront algorithm.

The following are the times taken by each algorithm to solve the grid:
Wavefront: 1.1920928955078125e-06
Recursion: 0.024811983108520508
Combination (recursion + quickfill): 0.00011801719665527344

Above is a partially completed grid (it contains 5 hints).
The following is a list of where the hints were inserted.
Insert a 9 in the cell in row 4 and column 9
Insert a 9 in the cell in row 5 and column 3
Insert a 1 in the cell in row 6 and column 7
Insert a 5 in the cell in row 2 and column 9
Insert a 6 in the cell in row 1 and column 5
