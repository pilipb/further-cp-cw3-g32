    '''
    This function is used to provide a hint to the user, if the -flag hint is set to True
    This will output the number of hints the user has requested, with the corresponding locations.

    Parameters
    ----------

    grid: list
        A list of lists representing a sudoku board (original)
    filled_in: list
        A list of the squares that have been filled in and their locations [value, row, column]
    hint_number: int
        The number of hints the user has requested

    Returns
    ----------
    hint_grid: list
        A list of lists representing a sudoku board with the hints added

    '''
    This function is used to find the squares that have been filled in and their locations by comparison
    of the original board and the solved board.

    Parameters
    ----------
